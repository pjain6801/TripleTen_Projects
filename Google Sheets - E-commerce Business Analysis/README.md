# Google Sheets - E-commerece Business Analysis


## Description of the Project:
Analyzing e-commerce transaction logs to build a conversion funnel, conduct cohort analysis, and calculate retention rates, providing data-driven insights for business growth.

## Project Goal:
The objective of this Business Analytics project is to analyze raw transaction logs from an e-commerce website to extract meaningful business insights.The analysis includes:

1) Building a Conversion Funnel – Understanding how well the website converts product page views into purchases by tracking user progression through key interaction stages.

2) Cohort Analysis Preparation – Identifying user acquisition cohorts based on their first purchase date and structuring data to facilitate retention tracking.

3) Retention Rate Calculation – Measuring customer retention over time by grouping users into cohorts and analyzing their purchasing behavior in subsequent months.

4) Data Organization & Executive Summary – Structuring findings into a polished report with clear insights and business recommendations.

### Tools and Libraries:
-	Google Sheets

## Results:
Conversion Funnel Performance:

- The website has a 10.34% conversion rate from viewers to purchasers, indicating a solid base of converting users but also room for optimization.

- 35.61% of viewers engage with the site enough to add items to the cart, showing strong initial interest but a need for improvement in guiding users toward purchase completion.

- 29.04% of users who add items to their cart ultimately complete the purchase, highlighting a potential area for improvement in reducing cart abandonment.

Retention Trends:

- Retention rates decline significantly across all cohorts, with a sharp drop-off in user engagement after the first month.

- By the fourth month, very few users remain active, suggesting a critical need to enhance customer retention strategies to maintain user engagement over time.


## Reccomendations:
Optimize the Checkout Process
- Streamline and simplify the checkout flow, offer incentives such as discounts or free shipping for cart abandoners, and implement retargeting strategies to increase the cart-to-purchase conversion rate.

Enhance Retention Strategies: 
- Develop personalized re-engagement campaigns, such as email marketing or loyalty programs, to improve user retention past the first month and keep customers returning for future purchases.
