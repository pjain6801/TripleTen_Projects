# Saving SuperStore 2 - The Causes of Returns


## Description of the Project:
Analyzing SuperStoreâ€™s returned orders to uncover key causes and create an actionable dashboard, aimed at reducing return rates and improving customer satisfaction
By analyzing various dimensions of the data, we aim to answer critical questions:

- What is the relationship between total sales and total returns? Do higher sales always lead to higher returns?
- Which product categories experience the highest return rates?
- Are there specific customer segments that are more likely to make returns?
- Is there a geographical concentration of returned orders, and does return rate vary by state?
- Is there a seasonal pattern to returned orders by month?
- What insights can we derive from return rates concerning state, year, product category, and ship mode?

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to identify the root causes of returned orders within SuperStore's operations and create an informative and interactive dashboard to present our findings, providing a clear visualization of the analysis.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Tableau: Utilize Tableau for data visualization and analysis.
