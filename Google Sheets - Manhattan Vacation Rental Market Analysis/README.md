The client seeks help in prioritizing their research by answering the following questions:

- How much revenue do these listings generate?
- Which properties are the most profitable?

## Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to deliver data-driven insights and recommendations that will empower our client to make informed decisions about investing in Manhattan vacation rental properties. Through a detailed analysis of Airbnb data, we will identify the most attractive neighborhoods, popular property sizes, and revenue potential, providing strategic guidance to help maximize the clientâ€™s return on investment and ensure the success of their vacation rental ventures.
