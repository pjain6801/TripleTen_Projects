## Description of the Problem:
A client seeks to strategically invest in Manhattan vacation rentals, requiring data-driven insights on optimal property types. We will leverage Airbnb data to reveal the most lucrative investment opportunities.
The client seeks help in prioritizing their research by answering the following questions:
- Which neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Which size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) are most popular for vacation rentals?
- How much revenue do these listings generate?
- Which properties are the most profitable?

## Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to deliver data-driven insights and recommendations that will empower our client to make informed decisions about investing in Manhattan vacation rental properties. Through a detailed analysis of Airbnb data, we will identify the most attractive neighborhoods, popular property sizes, and revenue potential, providing strategic guidance to help maximize the clientâ€™s return on investment and ensure the success of their vacation rental ventures.
