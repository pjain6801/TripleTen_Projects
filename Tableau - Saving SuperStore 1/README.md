# Data Visualization with Tableau

# Saving SuperStore


## Description of the Project:
Creating data-driven Tableau visualizations to identify key profit centers, optimize advertising strategies, and reduce product returns for improved SuperStore performance.
For each question, we will prepare an individual visualization:

1. Profits & losses.
First, we'll try to identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore.
- Among the pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) which are the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers? 
- Which products should the superstore stop selling? 
- Which product subcategories should the store focus on and which should they stop selling? Choose 3 of each.

2. Advertising:
The superstore wants to know if advertising would be worth it. Advertising works over time and geography, and our average profit per unit sold should be high enough to justify it.
- We will Identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in. 
- We will Make a visualization of the average profit for each month of the year for those 3 states and argue how much we would be willing to pay in advertising for those states in those months.
(We should be most willing to pay for advertisements based on the return on ad spend ratio. Let's say we should be willing to spend 1/5 of profits on advertising for this exercise.)

3. Returned items
 Weâ€™ll try see if some products have abnormal rates of being returned to the store.
- Which products have the highest return rate?
- Which customers have the highest return rate?
- We will make a visualization of the average profit against the average return rate on a shipping mode. Present a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to leverage Tableau's data visualization capabilities to analyze the SuperStore's profitability and make informed decisions. We aim to identify profit centers, loss-makers, and advertising opportunities. Additionally, we'll investigate product return rates to determine which products and customers are contributing to returns.

## Tools and Libraries:
- Tableau: Utilized for data visualization and analysis.
